MuSiC: Identifying mutational significance in cancer genomes

Introduction
-----
    The decreasing cost of sequencing has moved the focus of cancer genomics beyond single genome studies to the analysis of tens or hundreds
    of patients diagnosed with similar cancers. Besides the routine discovery and validation of SNVs, indels, and SVs in individual genomes, 
    it is now paramount to systematically analyze the function and recurrence of mutations across a cohort, and to describe how they interact 
    with one other or associate to clinical data. To this end we have developed the Mutational Significance In Cancer (MuSiC) suite of tools.
